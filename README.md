# Weekly Python Exercises scripts and solutions

This is a repository that contains useful scripts and projects created as part of Reuven Lerner's Weekly Python Exercises courses. The sample folder contains two prompts that allows potential students to have a taste of the kind of scripts you will be creating in the course. A1 is the current course I am enrolled in, aimed towards developers who have a basic understanding of Python but want to build intermediate fluency.
